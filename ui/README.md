### Framework Details
# Ui

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.3.4.\
`@Ionic` and `@Angular-Material` are also a part of this project.

## Development server

Run `npm install` to install all relevant packages.

If your node-version does not fit, look inside [package-lock.json](package-lock.json). Look for the `engines` param. Thats the best approach by now. Or on `ng serve` there will be a suggestion.

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
